# COMP330QuizSoftWare

### This is the Phase 1 of the main project for Comp330 at Loyola, taught by George K. Thiruvathukal. 

[Jack Brooks](https://github.com/jbrooks11) and [I](https://github.com/acrose99) are collaborating. 


### How it works 

1. Clone the repo
2. Either run QuizMain.py manually or type `python3 QuizMain.py`
3. From there you can either create or answer quizzes. Our CLI provides instructions for each step. 

* If you create a quiz, you can grade it using the same CLI. 
* When you create or answer a quiz, a file is written to the directory using a JSON file
* Unit testing is under the QuizTests test

#### Other Stuff

- We made all this code ourselves
- This uses vanilla code, so requirements.txt is blank  
- Git tag is 1.0
- Docker container: https://hub.docker.com/settings/linked-accounts
